\title{EPICS For MCB4B}

  These instructions already assume that you have installed the EPICS base(version 15), extensions, and synApps. If you have not please refer to
the other documentation for these steps. It should also be noted that we need the IP package in synApps, so if you have it commented out, uncomment it and 
rebuild the package. In theory installing synApps should give us a perfectly working motor record from which we could build all of our systems. However, 
there are several oddities that crop up in order to get the MCB4B record to work. 


 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Enter the synApps/support/motor-6-9 directory
  \item In the make file uncomment the lines for building examples
  \item In the release file in the configure directory make sure IPAC, ASYN, and MOTOR variables are defined
  \item In the makefile in the motorApp directory comment out all unwanted drivers, in this case we only want the AcsSrc one
  \item Moving to the the dbd directory in the PI\_GCS2Support.dbd file comment out the two include statements
  \item In the motorExApp/WithAsyn directory replace the make file with the corrected one found along with this documentation.
  \item Finally in the iocWithAsyn directory within iocBoot open the makefile and add \_64 to the architecture definition, and rerun make 
\end{itemize}  
  

This should be everything that you need to start making a MCB4B control system.
